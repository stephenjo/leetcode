# Question 9, Palindrome Number

# note: negative number not considered to be palindrome
# additional challened: how can this be done without converting to a string first?

# initial approach:
# reverse input and test if equal to original

# one approach to not converting to string is to loop through...very slow though

# check if input is negative, if so return false
# convert number to string, flip and check

#Solution: (run time is very poor)

if x<0:
	return (x>0)
else:
	res = [int(x) for x in str(x)]
	res.reverse()
	strng = [str(res) for res in res]
	strng = "".join(strng)
	rev_int = int(strng)

	return (rev_int==x)


# Alt Solution (in one line), found in comments, but still converts it to a string
return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
